            3. Estimated Delivery Timelines
          </h2>
          <p>
            Delivery timelines depend on your location and courier partner. As a
            general guide:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mt-2 space-y-1">
            <li>Metro / Tier-1 cities: 2–5 working days</li>
            <li>Other cities / towns: 3–7 working days</li>
            <li>Remote areas: 5–10 working days</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-2">
            These are estimated timelines and may vary due to logistics,
            weather, strikes, or other circumstances beyond our control.
